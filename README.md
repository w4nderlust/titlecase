# titlecase
Small script for converting filenames to titlecase

I made this for bulk rename the movies and music files. It takes a directory path and rename all files 8recurdively) in the directory. It works for English and Italian file names, but you can easly extend it adding a nel lowercase word list for you language. 

Run it like:
    python titlecase.py <directory_path>
